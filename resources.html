                  <h4>Motor Vehicle Report</h4>
                <p>Southern Mutual Church Insurance Company strongly believes that preventing losses before they happen benefits not only our policyholders, but more importantly, it protects the members and visitors of your church. We are committed to protecting your property by providing on-site inspections, by our trained personnel, at no cost to the church.</p>

                <h4>Safety First</h4>
                <p>From a safety standpoint SMCI believes having more than 8 drivers per vehicle is an increased risk due to a lack of training for a large number of drivers. Also, it is cost-prohibitive for us to run MVRs for a list of more than 8 drivers per vehicle. However, we understand there are times when churches feel they must exceed this limit, and we want to give those churches a tool they can use to provide us with additional MVRs at their own cost. As a part of our loss control procedures when insuring your church bus or van, we obtain Motor Vehicle Reports (MVRs) for the drivers list you provide to us, again at no cost to the church.</p>
                <p>SMCI is pleased to expand our relationship with IntellicorpRecords, Inc. Intellicorp has agreed to offer discounted MVRs to churches who mention their affiliation with SMCI. Since each state handles MVR requests differently, each church will need to call Intellicorp directly for procedures and pricing. Please call them toll-free at <a href="tel:18005393717">1-800-539-3717</a>, and mention to them you are affiliated with Southern Mutual Church Insurance Company.</p>

              <h3>TIS THE SEASON FOR CANDLES AND COLD</h3>
              <p>This is the time of season where we know some churches like to make use of real candles during Advent celebrations. Please be vigilant and assign someone in your congregation who will be responsible for making sure each candle has been properly extinguished. If a candle is not extinguished properly, it can suddenly relight as much as two hours later and could cause a major fire at your church.</p>
              <p>Cold weather is also setting in and pipes that freeze and burst can cause extensive damage to your church. If you have exposed water pipes in the ceiling or crawl space, we ask that you wrap them as soon as possible. You should also maintain a minimum temperature of 55 degrees in all buildings when not in use.</p>

                        <h3>Protecting the Children - Protecting the Church - Protecting Yourself</h3>
                           <p>Unfortunately, sexual misconduct against children is a growing problem in our country, and yes, even in the Church. Southern Mutual Church Insurance offers liability coverage to protect churches after an incident has occurred. However, we want to help churches prevent the abuse from happening in the first place. We have committed to providing this help in several ways.</p>
                          <p>First, download the <a href="http://www.smcins.com/pdf/ChildYouthManual.pdf" target="_blank">Child Youth Protection Manual</a>, or click the link at the bottom. This manual is full of useful tips your church can use as safeguards for your children. There are also several ready-to-use forms, such as an evaluation checklist and a volunteer worker application. This manual is free and we encourage you to save it and print as many copies as you need.</p>
                          <p>Second, we have several representatives ready to present our Child and Youth Protection Workshop to your church leaders and volunteers. This hour long workshop will equip you with the information you need to start a prevention program at your church or enhance the one you already have in place. Please contact Matthew Quinton at 803-776-9365 to make an appointment.</p>
                          
                          <blockquote>We are pleased to provide recommendations for two vendors that provide screening services.

                        <p>SMCI is receiving many questions and concerns from our churches, with the most frequently asked question being, "Can church members with a concealed carry permit bring their firearms onto the church premises?" This is a question that is becoming more common with the increase in violence. The final decision on allowing firearms on the premises rests with state law and the church leadership. However, if the church leadership decides to allow certain members to carry a concealed firearm, the church should be sure the person has a valid license/permit, along with firearms/security/safety training that goes well beyond what most states require to obtain a license/permit. Please note that just because someone has a license/permit doesn’t mean they should be allowed to carry a firearm on church premises, as some people are not suited to handle this responsibility. Obviously, this is a difficult issue and one that should be addressed in the church’s security plan. Be sure to enlist the expertise of local law enforcement and those in the legal field when developing your security plan</p>

                          <h3>Learning The Facts</h3>
                          <ol>
                              <li>Experts estimate that one in four girls and one in six boys 
                          are sexually abused before their eighteenth birthday.</li>
                              <li>The average age for reported sexual abuse is nine years old.</li>
                              <li>Twenty-two percent of victims are under the age of eight, 
                          and Only one in ten child victims report the abuse.</li>
                              <li>Children who are sexually abused and do not “tell” are at a 
                          far greater risk than the general population for a host of psychological, 
                          emotional, social, and physical problems, often lasting into adulthood.</li>
                          </ol>
                            <p>Minimize opportunity for abuse by eliminating one-adult/one-child 
          situations. Talk about it. Understand why children often keep abuse a 
          secret. Stay alert to signs of possible sexual abuse. </p>
                        
                          <h3>Reducing The Risk</h3>
                          <p>Here are some simple ideas your church can implement to help reduce the risk of sexual abuse in your congregation:</p>
                          <ol>
                              <li>Establish screening procedures for all volunteers.</li>
                              <li>Run background checks on employees and volunteers.</li>
                              <li>Institute a minimum six-month waiting period for 
                          volunteers.</li>
                              <li>Provide periodic and continuous training for staff and 
                          volunteers.</li>
                              <li>Maintain proper student/teacher ratios.</li>
                              <li>Be sure all rooms where children and youth meet have 
                          windows in the doors.</li>
                              <li>Eliminate one child-one adult interaction at all 
                          children/youth.</li>
                              <li>Provide counseling only in rooms where the door has a 
                          window or the door can be kept open at all times.</li>
                              <li>Never counsel or meet one-on-one at someone’s home.</li>
                          </ol>

                            <p>A sanctuary is a welcoming place of refuge and safety. In today's increasingly violent world, however, even our churches have come under attack. We no longer live in a time when we can ignore this fact and we must now find ways to protect our church families. This has led many church leaders to ask the question, "Where do we start?"</p>

                              <h3>Start With The Basics</h3>
                            <p>Build your Church Security Program on a solid foundation. There are three pillars of security on which you should base your program.</p>
                            <blockquote>TRAINING - PROTOCOLS - EQUIPMENT</blockquote>
                            <img src="images/blog/draco-pillars.png" style="float: right; max-width: 50%;">
                            <p>While you may be tempted to run out and purchase cameras for every corner of your buildings, without the proper protocols and training in place those cameras become an investigative tool after an incident.</p>
                            <p>Your initial focus should be on protocols and training, then add equipment as tools to enhance the capabilities of your Security Team. Listed below are several suggestions to get your Security Program started.</p>
                            <ol>
                              <li><i>Know your vulnerabilities</i>. Contact your local Sheriff's Department and ask if they have someone who specializes in security assessments. Alternatively, search for a security consulting firm in your area and have them come to your property to conduct a security assessment of your entire campus.</li>
                              <li><i>Recruit volunteers</i>. Form a Security Committee by first identifying a key member of the church to head the committee, someone who will be vigilant and passionate about their new role in the church, and then add as many other volunteers as you think is necessary to secure your church campus. Be sure to include any members of the church who are in the law enforcement or medical communities.</li>
                              <li><i>Begin immediately</i>. Do not wait. Once you have your security assessment in hand and a committee in place, immediately begin the process of building your Security Program. Immediately address the most vulnerable areas of your church campus.</li>
                              <li><i>Build on the basics</i>. Once the Security Committee has built a comprehensive security program, including training requirements, protocols, and incident response guidelines, have a church-wide meeting of all members to go over the program and the role of the average church member - child, youth, or adult - in the case of an incident.</li>
                                <li><i>Medical response</i>. All too often so much attention is placed on putting a security program into action, the medical response to a mass casualty incident is overlooked. You should also identify and recruit church members with a medical background to be a part of your Security Committee. They should be responsible for assessing the church's ability to respond in the case of one or more severe bleeding casualties. Every church should have multiple trauma kits staged throughout the church campus, along with several volunteers trained in the proper use of these kits.</li>
                            </ol>
